# Tokamak-Webpage
Contains code for Tokamak Webpage (TW). This page explores the workings of the tokamak, a device being used to make nuclear fusion power a reality. 

Note from 03/04/22 - When I created this site last year, it appears as if I did not believe in directory structure. I don't know why past me thought that this was a good idea. Due to the messiness of changing image links in multiple html files, I guess it will stay like this for now...
