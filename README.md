# Tokamak-Webpage
Contains code for Tokamak Webpage (TW). This page explores the workings of the tokamak, a device being used to make nuclear fusion power a reality. 

Note from 03/04/22 - When I created this site last year it seems that I did not believe in the concept of directory structure. I would change this if I did not have to go through multiple html files and play with image links.
