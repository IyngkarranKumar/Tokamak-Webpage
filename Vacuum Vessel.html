                Let's first delve further into the question of what we are shielding <i>from</i>. You may recall from previous pages that a fusion reaction involves two 
                isotopes of hydrogen as reactants (deuterium and tritium), which fuse and form two 
                products, an alpha (&#593;)  particle and a neutron. The reactants in this process 
                have a higher rest mass than the products, and so conservation of energy dictates that 
                the neutron and &#593; particle carry 17.6 MeV more kinetic energy than the products, of which 
                14.1 MeV is held by the neutron, and 3.5 MeV by the &#593;. 
                <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="Blanket.png"></a height=100% width=100%><figcaption>Figure 2: Simple depiction of the surrounding structures of the plasma domain. Created with <a href="https://app.biorender.com/">Bio Render</a></figcaption></figure>
                <br>The presence of the 14.1 MeV neutron is quite a pressing matter, as its interactions with surrounding structures are problematic to say the least.
                On collision with the reactor walls, the neutron can displace the wall's constituent molecules (a process known as sputtering) which often find a way 
                back into the plasma (backscattering). The effects of this are discussed in greater detail on the  
             <a href="Divertors.html">Divertor</a> page, but know that the presence of such impurities is only detrimental to achieving 
                net power output. The neutron also attacks the strutural integrity of surfaces it is incident upon, with the microscopic 
                voids left by the sputtered atoms becoming larger over time, leading to cracks and changes in the macroscopic behaviour of 
                the material. Diffusion of helium and tritium into the material structure further contribute to the degradation of the first wall. Mitigating this effect could save a good deal of money on the operational costs of a fusion power plant, by 
                reducing the need for replacement parts every few years. Further issues stemming from the 14.1 MeV neutron include the unwanted heating
                of the superconducting magnets confining the plasma (), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation" target="blank">neutron activation</a> and exposure of nearby organisms to ionising radiation, amplified by outgoing brehmsstralung and line emission radiation.<br>
                <br>To combat these problems, a tremendous amount of work has gone into developing effective shielding systems.  
                With regards to the structure and location of such systems, the first wall (the structure in direct contact with the plasma domain) is designed to provide a moderate amount of shielding, with auxiliary shielding 
                modules embedded deeper in the blanket to provide additional protection to the magnets and living organisms from high energy neutrons and 
                electromagnetic radiation, depicted in figure 2. Shields have thicknesses in the order of 10<sup>1</sup>cm, but due 
                to the stringent conditions on dimensions  (imposed with the goal of creating a compact reactor in mind), the real 
                beauty in these modules is the materials science that has been employed to make them as effective as possible. 
                <br>
                Unsurprisingly, Tungsten is a frontrunner in the list of potential shield materials. Its high melting point, low 
                coefficient of thermal expansion and low chance of neutrons activation make it well suited to the inside of a fusion 
                reactor, with its resistance to erosion also proving highly desirable. This can be seen if we define the sputtering 
                ratio, S, as the number of wall atoms back sputtered into the plasma per plasma ion incident on the wall;  from experiment we 
                find that Tungsten has the lowest sputtering ratio of the compounds found in a fusion reactor across practically all incident energies.
                <br> There are, of course, shortcomings. A limited temperature range, bounded by what are known as the brittle to 
                ductile transition temperature (BDTT) and the recrystallization temperature, constrict the range in which a metal can 
                be used as an effective structural material. In short, the BDTT is the temperature range below which a metal will lose its malleable properties, and in the process will become unsuitable to bear large stresses. The recrystallization temperature (range) can be summarised as follows: when large stresses are applied to a metal, its component crystallites (the microscopic crystals that make up the metal, also known as grains), are deformed, which endow the metal with suitable properties to be used in extreme conditions, such as increased tensile strength and hardness. At and above the recrystallization temperature range, these deformed grains are replaced by a new set of (undistorted) crystallites, making the metal lose such properties and not appropriate to use in say a tokamak. 
                Unfortunately, the BDTT and the recrystallization temperature for tungsten are relatively close<sup>1, reference</sup>, posing
                a restriction on its effectiveness as a shielding material. Other factors, involving the extremely high tendency for tungsten 
                to oxidize at high temperatures as well as the difficulty in manipulating the shape of forged tungsten provide incentives to 
                look for more suitable materials to be used to line the inside of a tokamak. 
                <br>A prime contender for the shielding material to be used inside a tokamak is 
                a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_matrix_composite" target="blank_">metal matrix composite </a> containing tungsten carbide/boride 
                (WC/WB). By embedding WC/WB (the aggregate) in a metal binder, which is likely to be an alloy of iron and chromium, the 
                resultant material is endowed with desirable qualities from both components; we see that the brittle nature of the aggregate 
                is overcome by the ductility of the binder, and the WC particles harden the material further. One may ask why a tungsten 
                <i>carbide/boride</i>  ceramic is used as supposed to a tungsten, iron and chromium-based alloy, but upon learning that 
                carbon is an effective neutron moderator, and boron-10 can absorb neutrons without becoming radioactive, the reason should 
                be clear. To do justice to the breadth of literature that exists covering the topics above, as well as the underlying physics 
                and chemistry, multiple webpages would have to be created; to keep things fairly concise I'll end this section by mentioning 
                that the proposed ceramic metal composites also have lower sputtering ratios than pure tungsten (on average by a factor 4) 
                and a lower coefficient of thermal expansion.
