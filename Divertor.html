                Here's an empowering thought. Whilst it may only be for a few seconds, the inside of a tokamak often reaches temperatures of 150 million degrees, making our planet the host to one of the hottest places in the 
                observable universe. Holding the plasma in this condition however is no simple task, and there exists various processes which can lead to significant 
                cooling, which of course must be avoided to retain a maximally hot and efficient plasma.
                This page will look at examples of the aforementioned cooling processes and will then delve into the geometry of the magnetic field in a tokamak. This will then be brought together to introduce the 
                divertor and limiter, two solutions that aim to retain the high temperature of our confined plasma, thereby ensuring that a net energy gain can be attained. 
                
                <br><br><h2 id="titles">Impurities</h2>
                As implied above, the particles in a tokamak reach tremendous speeds while confined, of the order 10<sup>6</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>. The possession of such energy
                enables plasma constituents to displace atoms in the reactor walls when the two collide (known as 'sputtering'), and some of these displaced nuclides find themselves entering the plasma. These estranged atoms, which generally have
                a much greater atomic number than the reactor fuel, are almost always seen as undesirable partly due to a phenomenon known as bremsstrahlung (braking) radiation. In short, this
                is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle when it is subject to a resultant force and it can be shown that the power loss due to bremsstrahlung is proportional to the 
                square of the particle's charge. To put this into perspective, we see that the power losses of a unit mass of tungsten (a common plasma impurity) purely due to bremsstrahlung radiation will be roughly 5500 times 
                greater than that of a unit mass of deuterium under the same conditions. It is also seen that impurities of high atomic number 
                do not fully ionise in the plasma, becoming a further source of radiative losses due to the constant excitation - emission - de-excitation cyle. 
                Evidently, the energy yield of a tokamak depends on how succesfully impurities can be removed and it turns out that the magnetic field inside our tokamak can be manipulated to help achieve this, which we will
                see now.
                
            

                <br><br><h2 id="titles">Flux Surfaces</h2>
                <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="Fluxsurfaces.pg.png"></a height=500px width=500px><figcaption>Figure 2: A cross section of a D-shaped plasma. Created with <a href="https://app.biorender.com/">Bio Render</a></figcaption></figure>
                The <a href="Magnets.html">Magnets </a> page of this website provides a description of the various roles served by the magnetic fields to bound a plasma inside the tokamak, however
                if chosen carefully, the fields can also assist in the mitigation of impurity effects. Using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model which
                provides both an accurate and tractable description of electrically conducting fluids, it can be seen that
                there exist two distinct classes of field lines in the plasma confined by a tokamak, closed and open field lines. 
                Figure 2 depicts the cross section of a D-shaped plasma, with the closed field in blue and the open field in red. Of course
                our tokamak is a 3 dimensional machine, and the closed field lines form closed, nested surfaces when we rotate the cross section by 2&pi; radians in the toroidal 
                direction, which are known as <b>closed flux surfaces</b>. The open field lines similarly form <b>open flux surfaces</b>.
                <br>The reason this is important is because particles can exhibit quite cooperative behaviour when subject to a cleverly chosen magnetic field. In particular, the guiding centre of
                the gyration of a particle remains ON a flux surface, with little tendency to move radially outward/inward to another such surface (except due to collisions).Therefore, 
                if a particle finds itself on an open flux surface (which impurities often do as they are sputtered from the wall), it will most likely remain there until 
                the surface intersects with the reactor wall. The points where open flux surfaces intersect with the wall can be specially designed to remove impurities which finally brings
                us onto the divertor and limiter.

                <br><br><h2 id="titles">Divertor and Limiter</h2>
                We'll begin with the limiter,  first introduced to tokamaks in the late 1970's. Take note of the name, 
                the limiter is designed to 'limit' the impurities in a plasma and does not remove them, unlike a divertor, hence the reason for 
                the popularity of the divertor in most machines today. The limiter is a structure positioned such that it intersects with the open flux surfaces (collectively known as the Scrape-off Layer, or SOL)
                prior to the flux surfaces coming into contact with the reactor walls. This still leads to sputtering and impurities,
                but the source of the sputtered atoms is now the limiter instead of the reactor walls so if the limiter is chosen to be made from a 
                material of low Z number (which the reactor wall cannot afford the privilege of having), we see that the bremsstrahlung and line emission losses 
                are decreased. Conventional limiters are manufactured from graphite (an allotrope of carbon), whilst reactor walls are constructed with stainless steel (an iron-based
                alloy with 10% chromium.) Comparing these substances, we see that the average Z number of the graphite will be 6, compared to roughly 26 for stainless steel; this should hopefully 
                make clear the motivation behind the use of a limiter.<br>
                <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="Divertor.png"></a><figcaption>Figure 3: A model of a divertor, with the inner vertical target (IVT), central dome (CD) and outer vertical target (OVT) labelled </figcaption></figure>
                However we can, and must, do better. The limiter still leads to the addition of impurities into the plasma, just from
                less damaging sources, and whilst limiters still line the walls of many tokamaks, the divertor reigns supreme when 
                it comes to mitigating impurity effects. So finally, what is a divertor? It is best described as an exchange system 
                comprised of multiple metallic plates arranged in such a way that both impurities and excess heat can be transferred
                out of the tokamak. A quick reference to Figure 1, 3 or <a href="https://www.iter.org/mach/Divertor" target= "blank_">the ITER 
                page on the subject </a> should provide a visualisation of this. As already mentioned above, one of the aims 
                of the divertor is to rid the fusing plasma of any impurities that may have entered it. These impurities in 
                the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) are transported along the flux lines toward the divertor region where the inner vertical target, central dome and outer vertical target (Fig 3) direct 
                the matter such that 
                it undergoes circular motion, shown by the blue lines on figure 1. Due to the larger centrifugal force that is 
                exerted on the higher mass impurities, these are flung out of the divertor, and the fuel particles which were forced into the region can be extracted and re-deposited into the reactor. 
                <br>The divertor also serves to rid the plasma of the excess thermal energy that the products of the fusion reaction will have.  Complex 
                networks of pipes travel underneath the main body of the component carrying coolant (often water) which transports the thermal energy 
                of incoming particles (that collide with the divertor plates) away to be used to produce electricity. 
                This constant bombardment requires that the divertor be made from a material that can deal with such high heat flux per second, 
                and tungsten, with its 3500 degree melting point, was chosen for exactly this reason.(and is often the origin of many tungsten impurities in 
                the plasma).
