                Here's an empowering thought. Whilst it may only be for a few seconds, the inside of a tokamak often reaches temperatures of 150 million degrees, making it one of the hottest places in the 
                observable universe during operation. Holding the plasma in this condition however is no simple task, and there exists various processes which lead to significant 
                cooling of the plasma. One of the key obstacles that has to be overcome for those pioneering fusion research is to limit the effects of such processes to as great an extent as possible, thereby retaining a maximally hot and efficient plasma. This naturally leads us to the introduction of
                the divertor, a remarkable feat of engineering that serves exactly this purpose.

                Before we look at the solution, let's flesh out the problem a bit more. As implied above, the particles in a tokamak reach tremendous speeds while confined, of the order 10<sup>6</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>. The possession of such energy
                enables plasma constituents to displace atoms in the reactor walls when the two collide, and some of these displaced nuclides find themselves entering the plasma. These estranged atoms, which generally have
                a much greater atomic number than the reactor fuel, are almost always seen as undesirable partly due to a phenomenon known as bremsstrahlung (braking) radiation. In short, this
                is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle when it is subject to a resultant force and it can be shown that the power loss due to bremsstrahlung is proportional to the 
                square of the particle's charge. To put this into perspective, we see that the power losses of a unit mass of tungsten (a common plasma impurity) purely due to bremsstrahlung radiation will be roughly 5500 times 
                greater than that of a unit mass of deuterium at the same density and temperature. It is also seen that impurities of high atomic number 
                do not fully ionise in the plasma, becoming a further source of radiative losses due to the constant excitation - emission - de-excitation cyle. 
                Evidently, the energy yield of a tokamak depends on how succesfully impurities can be removed, so now we turn our discussion to the devices which aim to do this.
