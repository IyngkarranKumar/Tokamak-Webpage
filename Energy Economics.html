                    Once a fusion reactor is developed that consistently achieves breakeven, one of the next steps is to integrate it into the electric grid. This is not as simple as hooking it up to a few pylons 
                    and pressing the ON button as multiple other factors now come into play, one being the cost of the electricity that the reactor produces.
                    Of course, if the advent of fusion reactors does not provide atleast a small financial incentive to utility companies, it is 
                    unlikely that they will be be implemented on the scale that some of us envision. For this reason, the following text will 
                    be devoted to analysing the cost of producing electrical power, as well as where fusion will fit into the mix, now and in 
                    the future.  
                    <br>
                    As we need to compare the costs of fusion energy with other current sources, this page will be 
                    less tokamak-oriented. To start, we'll answer the question of how one goes about quantifying the cost of producing 
                    electricity and discuss the variables that this is dependent on. After that, the economics of a tokamak will be
                    looked at; we'll see which components make up the largest proportion of this cost, and what is being/could be done to 
                    tackle this.  The rest of the page will then be focused on the economics of various other energy sources, and 
                    comparisons will be drawn with nuclear fission and natural gas, the two other methods of producing baseload power<sup>1</sup>. 
                    Let's get into it.</div>
                <br><br>
                <h2 id="titles">Calculating Costs</h2><div id="text">
                We'll focus on quantifying the cost of just electricity here and not energy use in total. Although electricity is the main way of 
                powering our societies, there are many things we use on a day-to-day basis that function by harnessing alternate energy stores,
                such as the vast majority of automobiles (which rely on petrol/diesel), as well as the systems running on natural gas that heat our 
                homes. But even these are changing as we transition to a carbon-free planet (hydrogen appears to be the fuel of the future, but that's a whole other story). <br>
                <br>
                The conventional metric used for such a task is the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). If we consider the
                total lifetime costs of a power source, the LCOE is the cost at which each unit of energy 
                produced over the lifetime of this source must be sold at in order for the investment to break-even.
                <br>Mathematically, this is expressed as:<br>
                The numerator of this fraction is, as expected, the total lifetime costs of our plant, with I<sub>t</sub> representing 
                the loan repayments (with interest) per year, M<sub>t</sub> denoting the operation and maintenance costs 
                and F<sub>t</sub> the fuel costs, all in year t. An I<sub>0</sub> term is also included to account for the initial investment costs.  The denominator is simply the total energy produced
                over n years of operation. The LCOE is often estimated many years before the end of operation of 
                a power plant, so it is required to make predictions for costs and revenues decades into the future. For 
                this reason, a discount rate r is included in the equation, which aims to account for the 
                inflationary nature of money over time (as well as other factors, such as the perceived risk of the 
                investment). <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="CapFactor.png" width="600px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2: The capacity factors for various sources.

                <br>But this is not the full story.To further understand the costs of producing electricity, we need to also consider what is known as 
                the capacity factor (C). This is defined as the ratio between the actual electricity output of a 
                source and the maximum possible electricity output over some unit of time.  So for example, if 
                an array of solar panels produced n KWh of electrical energy over say, a week, but it has the
                potential to produce pn KWh per week, then its capacity factor is p<sup>-1</sup>. To see why 
                such a quantity influences electricity costs, consider the position of a utility company that 
                is operating a power plant with a 50% capacity factor. From the LCOE, we have seen that the
                cost of electricity is given by the total cost divided by total energy output,  so by only
                operating at 50% capacity the plant effectively doubles its cost (by producing only half
                of the energy that is has the ability to). In countries such as the UK, this is seen mainly as 
                a problem for intermittent power supplies due to erratic behaviour of the weather on which they
                are so highly dependent. A very rough but simple quantification of this shows us that plant operating
                with a capacity factor of &Kappa;  will see an increase in costs of a
                factor &Kappa;<sup>-1</sup>.

        <div id="text" style="font-size: small;">1. I feel like I should mention that I do not intend to deprecate one power source when making such comparisons. I actively try to
        prevent bias developing towards one energy source over others, however from a young age nuclear fusion has been a method of generation that 
        I believed will be a part of our future, and that we should accelerate its arrival. If you are interested, I personally believe that fusion, solar
        and hydrogen will be the energy sources of the future (although from what I've read, thorium also seems promising)</div>
