                    Once a functioning fusion reactor is developed, one of the next stages is widespread integration onto the electric grid. This is not as simple as hooking it up to a few pylons 
                    and pressing the ON button as multiple other factors now come into play, one being the cost of the electricity that the reactor produces.
                    Of course, if the advent of fusion reactors does not provide atleast a small financial incentive to utility companies, it is 
                    unlikely that they will be be implemented on the scale that some of us envision. For this reason, the following text will 
                    be devoted to analysing the cost of producing electrical power, as well as where fusion will fit into the mix, now and in 
                    the future.  
                    <br>
                    As we need to compare the costs of fusion energy with other current sources, this page will be 
                    less tokamak-oriented. To start, we'll answer the question of how one goes about quantifying the cost of producing 
                    electricity and discuss the variables that this is dependent on. After that, the economics of a tokamak will be
                    looked at; we'll see which components make up the largest proportion of this cost, and what is being/could be done to 
                    tackle this. Comparisons will be drawn with other methods of electricity generation, especially nuclear fission due to the many similarities that a fusion and fission power plant will have. 
                    Let's get into it.</div>
                
                <h2 id="titles">Calculating Costs</h2><div id="text">
                How does one go about putting a price on electricity? 
                The conventional metric used for such a task is the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). If we consider the
                total lifetime costs of a power source, the LCOE is the cost at which each unit of energy 
                produced over the lifetime of this source must be sold at in order for the investment to break-even. This is expressed mathematically in Figure 2.
             <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="LCOE.png" width="300px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2: LCOE equation</figcaption></figure>
                The numerator of this fraction is, as expected, the total lifetime costs of our plant, with I<sub>t</sub> representing 
                the loan repayments (with interest) per year, M<sub>t</sub> denoting the operation and maintenance costs 
                and F<sub>t</sub> the fuel costs, all in year t. An I<sub>0</sub> term is also included to account for the initial investment costs.  The denominator is simply the total energy produced
                over n years of operation. The LCOE is often estimated many years before the end of operation of 
                a power plant, so it is required to make predictions for costs and revenues decades into the future. For 
                this reason, a discount rate (1+r)<sup>t</sup> is included in the equation, which aims to account for the 
                inflationary nature of money over time (as well as other factors, such as the perceived risk of the 
                investment). In short, a discount rate allows one to consider cashflows in future years in terms of the value of money at the present moment.
                <br>But this is not the full story.To further understand the costs of producing electricity, we need to also consider what is known as 
                the capacity factor (C). This is defined as the ratio between the actual electricity output of a 
                source and the maximum possible electricity output over some unit of time.  So for example, if 
                an array of solar panels produced n KWh of electrical energy over say, a week, but it has the
                potential to produce pn KWh per week, then its capacity factor is p<sup>-1</sup>. To see why 
                such a quantity influences electricity costs, consider the position of a utility company that 
                is operating a power plant with a 50% capacity factor. From the LCOE, we have seen that the
                cost of electricity is given by the total cost divided by total energy output,  so by only
                operating at 50% capacity the plant effectively doubles its cost (by producing only half
                of the energy that the capital investment endowed it to). In countries such as the UK, this is seen mainly as 
                a problem for intermittent power supplies due to erratic behaviour of the weather on which they
                are so highly dependent. A very rough but simple quantification of this shows us that plant operating
                with a capacity factor of &Kappa;  will see an increase in the LCOE of a <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="CapFactor.png" width="100%"></a><figcaption>Figure 3: The capacity factors for various sources. Photovoltaics<br> are not depicted however they range from 20%-30% in most places.

                factor &Kappa;<sup>-1</sup>.<br><br>

                <h2 id="titles">Tokamak Economics</h2><div id="text"><br>
                Let's return to nuclear fusion and the tokamak now. This section will look at the various 
                parameters that comprise the LCOE from a fusion perspective as well as what is/could be done 
                to run these costs down in order to make fusion competitive with other baseload power supplies 
                as soon as possible.    <br>
                The easiest component of the LCOE to address here is fuel, in which fusion triumphs over 
                practically all other baseload energy sources. It is commonly 
                known that 1kg of fusion fuel (which partly comprises of the abundant hydrogen isotope deuterium, 
                found in any water source on the planet) has the potential to release the equivalent thermal energy 
                of millions of kilograms of coal; such elegance and efficiency in the process of energy extraction is one of the reasons that attracted me, and many others I'm sure, to the fusion 
                industry. Tritium is the other participant in the fusion reaction being targeted here on Earth, which due to its rarity is 
                fairly expensive. ITER will test the concept of a tritium breeding blanket (discussed on the reactor blankets page) which if engineered will allow 
                the tokamak to create its own tritium (from the absorption of a neutron by lithium, which is a readily available substance). We can therefore conclude that fuel costs will be almost negligible in a tokamak with a tritium breeding blanket.<br> 
                <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="Tritium.jpg" width="300px"></a><figcaption>Figure 3: A vial of tritium displaying radioluminescence.<br> A fusion reactor will require ~ 50kg annually<br> exceeding the total 20kg stored on the earth. <br>This should make clear the need for a tritium breeding blanket.</figcaption></figure>
                <br>The operation and maintenance costs (denoted by M<sub>t</sub>) should not be too difficult to 
                estimate due to the similarities with the baseload power stations today. Although a
                fusion reactor will be an amalgamation of the feats of human engineering,
                its primary purpose remains to turn water into steam, like all other thermal power
                plants.  For this reason, one could gain a ballpark figure of the M<sub>t</sub> costs of a
                proposed fusion plant through comparison with a currently operational thermal power plant 
                of similar output of which a nuclear fission plant seems the most sensible. Of course, there will be a few differences between fission and fusion
                power plant operations. Whilst fusion does avoid <b>directly</b> producing highly 
                radioactive waste products, the high energy 14.1 MeV neutron produced in D-T (deuterium
                -tritium) reactions can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation#:~:text=Neutron%20activation%20is%20the%20process%20in%20which%20neutron,formation%20of%20an%20unstable%20activation%20product.%20Such%20radioactiveof">neutron activation</a> of surrounding 
                materials, which causes parts of the reactor to become radioactive and harms its 
                structural integrity. The plasma facing walls of a tokamak may be required to be replaced
                relatively often due to this high neutron flux (every 6-7 years<sup><a href="Citations.html">1</a></sup>), which will contribute to a large
                chunk of maintenance costs. Note that the activated materials have a radioactive half-life many
                orders of magnitude less than that of fission products, so fusion power stations will
                still incur costs of dealing with radioactive materials but to a much lesser extent than their fission counterparts. 
                The study of materials that are both suitable to use inside a reactor and which are not
                greatly activated by high neutron fluxes is a topic of very high interest at the moment.<br><br>

                
                The final component of the numerator of the LCOE is one that accounts for the initial and
                loan repayment costs of a power plant. This is perhaps the hardest cost to predict as many 
                of the components required by a fusion reactor are unique and have been developed solely for
                this purpose, so it remains to be seen how low these costs can be driven without first 
                building an operating fusion power plant.
                To obtain rough figures for various components, I used a 2018 paper ("Approximation of the economy of fusion
                energy"- S.Entler, J.Horacek, T.Dlouhy, V.Dostal<sup><a href="Citations.html">1</a></sup>) that conducts an ex-ante analysis of the
                economics of the proposed DEMO fusion power plant. For those who are unaware, DEMO is a proposed power plant to follow after the conclusion of the ITER experiment, with aims to finally deliver fusion energy to the grid. Its first operation is currently planned for the 2050's.  

                <br>The breakdown of the main costs of a tokamak based fusion power plant are summarised in the table below (M$ denotes millions of dollars):<br><br>

                </table>

                <br>These, along with other costs that I have omitted for now (such as maintenance costs) 
                sum to give a direct cost of $6000 million. Indirect costs (overhead and administrative
                expenses) as well as contingency costs (to make up for uncertainty in the direct costs
                above) then leave us with the final $8500 million figure. It is worth noting that these are 'overnight' costs, 
                i.e the costs if the plant was built overnight and factoring in interest payments could double the $8500 million value. Therefore time is of the essence when constructing such a plant and a large part of fusion's success will depend on whether power plants can be constructed rapidly enough to avoid burgeoning interest repayments.
                Good news however lies in the fact that most of the costs in the table above are accounted for by fusion-specific components 
                (75% of direct costs in fact). We can expect these 'prototype' components that will be 
                employed in DEMO to see a significant fall in price once larger scale production begins. 
                <br>
                Finally, we can begin to make comparisons with other electricity sources. The two 
                metrics we use will be the LCOE (defined above) and the TCOE (LCOE modified to include 
                <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/external-costs/#:~:text=%20Definition%20of%20External%20costs%20%201%20An,the%20consumption/production%20of%20one%20extra%20unit.%20More" target="_blank">external costs</a>) although the paper in which the 
                figures have been taken from displays several graphs that provide further insight into 
                the economics of a fusion power plant, which I highly recommend taking a look at. 
                <p>It was found that the limit sales price (the lowest possible selling price) of one MWh of fusion generated electricity 
                (using the DEMO model) will roughly be $175 dollars.  The current market price at 
                the time of writing was $34 in the EU, thereby incurring a $141 subsidy to make the 
                fusion energy competitive. Again, this appears to be a large amount but compared to 
                the subsidies required by wind and photovoltaic methods of generation, it is the 
                lowest figure (subsidies for intermittents must account for having a baseload power 
                station on standby in the case of insufficient supply). The paper then goes onto conclude that the LCOE 
                and TCOE of a first generation fusion power plant will be around $110 and $120 
                respectively. Where do these figures stand in comparison to other electricity generating 
                sources? Well, of the 7 sources considered (fusion, fission, coal, natural gas, offshore 
                wind, onshore wind and solar), fusion's LCOE places it as 5th cheapest, but its extremely 
                low external costs then rank it second cheapest when considering the TCOE (bested only by 
                current nuclear fission technologies). Considering that this analysis has been undertaken on 
                a plant not even designed for full commerical power production, the result above is very promising.<br>
                It is worth stressing again that these are only very rough figures, as they must be when analysing 
                the economic performance of a power plant that is predicted to only begin operation midway through 
                this century.  Costs of electricity from DEMO will be higher than predicted here due to the 
                neglection of interest payments on the loan taken to fund such an endeavour. However, with time one 
                can only expect to see costs tumble further, and therefore I truly believe that fusion is destined to become
                the baseload power supply of the future.


                <h5 id="titles">What's next</h5><div id="text"></div>
                I'm aware that there are a few statements in the text above that need further discussion. In particular, over the past few
                weeks I have been looking at the reason current nuclear power seems to be being phased out in a number of countries when just a few
                decades ago it was thought that it would give us energy in abundance. To put it plainly, the reason is largely economical as nuclear fission power has seen <b>a rise</b> in cost since its inception into our society; delays, regulation and 
                standardisation all play a part in this shortcoming. <br>
                Therefore I want to devote a section discussing what must be done to ensure that a similar fate does not befall nuclear fusion, and why I believe that it will not. The issue of
                nuclear energy in general is a thorny and controversial one to say the least, and we have both the privilege and responsibility to decide whether it powers our planet in the coming decades.
