                <div id="text">For those with interest in the many facets of the energy industry, like myself, the end goal is the development 
                    of energy sources  that have the ability to provide this planet with energy in abundance. I particularly despise 
                    the phrase 'energy-intensive process',  . With that being said, how exactly should one measure the abundance of 
                    energy is in our society? I believe that the best metric is the cost per unit kilowatt-hour used; if we are able 
                    to produce dirt cheap energy en masse (that is of no detriment to our environment), industries will have the 
                    freedom to go about their work without being hindered to a great extent by the electricity cost of their 
                    activities, hence abolishing the 'energy-intensive' processes. of today. This paragraph needs work. Don't 
                    use 'dirt cheap'. But what if I want to? No. Yes. No.
                    As we need to compare the costs of fusion energy with other current sources, this page will be 
                    less tokamak-oriented. To start, we'll answer the question of how one goes about quantifying the cost of producing 
                    electricity and discuss the variables that this is a function of. After that, the economics of a tokamak will be
                    looked at; we'll see which components make up the largest proportion of this cost, and what is/could be done to 
                    tackle this.  The rest of the page will then be focused on the economics of various other energy sources, and 
                    comparisons will be drawn with nuclear fission and natural gas, the two other methods of producing baseload power<sup>1</sup>. 
                    Let's get into it.</div>

        <div id="text" style="font-size: small;">1. I feel like I should mention that I do not intend to deprecate one power source when making such comparisons. I actively try to
        prevent bias developing towards one energy source over others, however from a young age nuclear fusion has been a method of generation that 
        I believed will be a part of our future, and that we should accelerate its arrival. If you are interested, I personally believe that fusion, solar
        and hydrogen will be the energy sources of the future (although from what I've read, thorium also seems promising)</div>
