                    Once a fusion reactor is developed that consistently achieves breakeven, one of the next steps is to integrate it into the electric grid. This is not as simple as hooking it up to some pylons 
                    and pressing the ON button; multiple other factors now come into play, one being the cost of the electricity that our reactor produces.
                    Of course, if the advent of fusion reactors does not provide atleast a small financial incentive to utility companies, it is 
                    unlikely that they will be be implemented on the scale that some of us envision. For this reason, the following text will 
                    be devoted to analysing the cost of producing electrical power, as well as where fusion will fit into the mix, now and in 
                    the future.  
                    <br>
                    As we need to compare the costs of fusion energy with other current sources, this page will be 
                    less tokamak-oriented. To start, we'll answer the question of how one goes about quantifying the cost of producing 
                    electricity and discuss the variables that this is dependent on. After that, the economics of a tokamak will be
                    looked at; we'll see which components make up the largest proportion of this cost, and what is being/could be done to 
                    tackle this.  The rest of the page will then be focused on the economics of various other energy sources, and 
                    comparisons will be drawn with nuclear fission and natural gas, the two other methods of producing baseload power<sup>1</sup>. 
                    Let's get into it.</div>

                <h2 id="titles">Calculating Costs</h2><div id="text">
                We'll focus on quantifying the cost of just electricity here and not energy use in total. Although electricity is the prominent way of 
                powering our societies, there are a few things we use on a day-to-day basis that function by harnessing alternate energy stores,
                such as the vast majority of automobiles (which rely on petrol/diesel), as well as the systems running on natural gas that heat our 
                homes. But even these are changing as we transition to a carbon-free planet. In particular, the relationship between electric and 
                hydrogen energy stores looks very promising indeed.<br>
                Mathematically, this is written:</div> <br>

        <div id="text" style="font-size: small;">1. I feel like I should mention that I do not intend to deprecate one power source when making such comparisons. I actively try to
        prevent bias developing towards one energy source over others, however from a young age nuclear fusion has been a method of generation that 
        I believed will be a part of our future, and that we should accelerate its arrival. If you are interested, I personally believe that fusion, solar
        and hydrogen will be the energy sources of the future (although from what I've read, thorium also seems promising)</div>
