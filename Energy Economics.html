                    Once a fusion reactor is developed that consistently achieves breakeven, one of the next steps is to integrate it into the electric grid. This is not as simple as hooking it up to a few pylons 
                    and pressing the ON button as multiple other factors now come into play, one being the cost of the electricity that the reactor produces.
                    Of course, if the advent of fusion reactors does not provide atleast a small financial incentive to utility companies, it is 
                    unlikely that they will be be implemented on the scale that some of us envision. For this reason, the following text will 
                    be devoted to analysing the cost of producing electrical power, as well as where fusion will fit into the mix, now and in 
                    the future.  
                    <br>
                    As we need to compare the costs of fusion energy with other current sources, this page will be 
                    less tokamak-oriented. To start, we'll answer the question of how one goes about quantifying the cost of producing 
                    electricity and discuss the variables that this is dependent on. After that, the economics of a tokamak will be
                    looked at; we'll see which components make up the largest proportion of this cost, and what is being/could be done to 
                    tackle this.  The rest of the page will then be focused on the economics of various other energy sources, and 
                    comparisons will be drawn with nuclear fission and natural gas, the two other methods of producing baseload power<sup>1</sup>. 
                    Let's get into it.</div>
                <br><br>
                <h2 id="titles">Calculating Costs</h2><div id="text">
                We'll focus on quantifying the cost of electricity here and not other energy sources that power (most) of our automobiles and heat our homes.
                The conventional metric used for such a task is the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). If we consider the
                total lifetime costs of a power source, the LCOE is the cost at which each unit of energy 
                produced over the lifetime of this source must be sold at in order for the investment to break-even.
                <br>Mathematically, this is expressed as:<br>
                The numerator of this fraction is, as expected, the total lifetime costs of our plant, with I<sub>t</sub> representing 
                the loan repayments (with interest) per year, M<sub>t</sub> denoting the operation and maintenance costs 
                and F<sub>t</sub> the fuel costs, all in year t. An I<sub>0</sub> term is also included to account for the initial investment costs.  The denominator is simply the total energy produced
                over n years of operation. The LCOE is often estimated many years before the end of operation of 
                a power plant, so it is required to make predictions for costs and revenues decades into the future. For 
                this reason, a discount rate r is included in the equation, which aims to account for the 
                inflationary nature of money over time (as well as other factors, such as the perceived risk of the 
                investment). <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="CapFactor.png" width="600px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2: The capacity factors for various sources.

                <br>But this is not the full story.To further understand the costs of producing electricity, we need to also consider what is known as 
                the capacity factor (C). This is defined as the ratio between the actual electricity output of a 
                source and the maximum possible electricity output over some unit of time.  So for example, if 
                an array of solar panels produced n KWh of electrical energy over say, a week, but it has the
                potential to produce pn KWh per week, then its capacity factor is p<sup>-1</sup>. To see why 
                such a quantity influences electricity costs, consider the position of a utility company that 
                is operating a power plant with a 50% capacity factor. From the LCOE, we have seen that the
                cost of electricity is given by the total cost divided by total energy output,  so by only
                operating at 50% capacity the plant effectively doubles its cost (by producing only half
                of the energy that the capital investment endowed it to). In countries such as the UK, this is seen mainly as 
                a problem for intermittent power supplies due to erratic behaviour of the weather on which they
                are so highly dependent. A very rough but simple quantification of this shows us that plant operating
                with a capacity factor of &Kappa;  will see an increase in the LCOE of a
                factor &Kappa;<sup>-1</sup>.<br><br>

                <h2 id="titles">Tokamak Economics</h2><div id="text"><br>
                <h5 id="titles">Add images for the love of god</h5>
                Let's return to nuclear fusion and the tokamak now. This section will look at the various 
                parameters that comprise the LCOE from a fusion perspective as well as what is/could be done 
                to run these costs down in order to make fusion competitive with other baseload power supplies 
                as soon as possible.    <br>
                The easiest component of the LCOE to address here is fuel, in which fusion triumphs over 
                practically all other energy sources, whether they are baseload or intermittent. It is commonly 
                known that 1kg of fusion fuel (which partly comprises of the abundant hydrogen isotope deuterium, 
                found in any water source on the planet) has the potential to release the equivalent thermal energy 
                of millions of kilograms of coal; such elegance and efficiency in the process of electricity 
                generation is one of the reasons that attracted me, and many others I'm sure, to the fusion 
                industry. Tritium is the other participant in the fusion reaction being targeted here on Earth, so
                if a self-sustaining tritium breeding blanket is engineered (this is discussed on the blankets page) 
                then the fuel costs are almost negligible.<br> 
                The operation and maintenance costs (denoted by M<sub>t</sub>) should not be too difficult to 
                estimate due to the similarities with the baseload power stations today. Even though the 
                fusion reactor is an amalgamation of some of the very greatest feats of engineering seen in
                history, its primary purpose remains to turn water into steam, like all other thermal power
                plants.  For this reason, one could gain a ballpark figure of the M<sub>t</sub> costs of a
                proposed fusion reactor through comparison with a currently operational thermal power plant 
                of similar output. Of course, there will be a few differences between fission and fusion
                power plant operations. Whilst fusion does avoid <b>directly</b> producing highly 
                radioactive waste products, the high energy 14.1 MeV neutron produced in D-T (deuterium
                -tritium) reactions can lead to neutron activation<sup>footnote</sup> of surrounding 
                materials, which causes parts of the reactor to become radioactive and reduces its 
                structural integrity. The plasma facing walls of a tokamak may be required to be replaced
                quite often due to this high neutron flux (every 6-7 years<sup><a href="Citations.html">3</a></sup>), which will contribute to a large
                chunk of maintenance costs. Note that the activated materials have a radioactive half-life many
                orders of magnitude less than that of fission products, so fusion power stations will
                still incur costs of dealing with radioactive materials, but to a much lesser extent. 
                The study of materials that are both suitable to use inside a reactor and which are not
                greatly activated by high neutron fluxes is a topic of very high interest at the moment.<br>

                
                The final component of the numerator of the LCOE is one that accounts for the initial and
                loan repayment costs of a power plant. This is perhaps the hardest cost to predict as many 
                of the components required by a fusion reactor are unique and have been developed solely for
                this purpose, so it remains to be seen how low these costs can be driven without first 
                building an operating fusion power plant. For now, we'll take the costs in the present day 
                (March 2020), but note that all these components have so far been designed and built with
                experimental and research purposes in mind. We'll also draw some comparisons with fission 
                along the way, and see what could be done to avoid some of the delays and cost overruns
                that the construction of a nuclear power plant is infamous for.<br>
                The following figures are taken from a 2018 paper that conducts an ex-ante analysis of the
                economics of the proposed DEMO fusion power plant ("Approximation of the economy of fusion
                energy"- S.Entler, J.Horacek, T.Dlouhy, V.Dostal)<sup><a href="Citations.html">3</a></sup>.

        <div id="text" style="font-size: small;">1. I feel like I should mention that I do not intend to deprecate one power source when making such comparisons. I actively try to
        prevent bias developing towards one energy source over others, however from a young age nuclear fusion has been a method of generation that 
        I believed will be a part of our future, and that we should accelerate its arrival. If you are interested, I personally believe that fusion, solar
        and hydrogen will be the energy sources of the future (although from what I've read, thorium also seems promising)</div>
