                The general impression I got when first looking into a tokamak was: 'the magnets 
                confine and sustain the fusion reaction, and the reactor blanket does pretty much everything else'. Hopefully
                this website has shown that this is certainly <i>not</i> the case, but I believe that these
                initial thoughts were due to the exceptionally wide range of essential functions that the reactor blanket must serve to enable the continuous operation of a tokamak.
                Indeed, none of the other components that have been or will be introduced must play as many roles as the reactor blanket does, and on this page I aim to introduce a few of the most significant ones. 
                <br>The reactor blanket is the term used to describe the immediate surrounding structures of the plasma 
                domain (the region in which the fusing plasma is confined). <br>It must serve <b>four</b> key 
                functions: 
                <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" width=400px height=300px alt="Nuclear Power plant" src="powerplant.jpg"><figcaption>Figure 1: Thermal Power station</figcaption></figure>                    
                <ol>
                <li>Protect the magnets (which are just a few metres away from the plasma domain), as well as other surrounding structures and human personnel from electromagnetic radiation and high-energy neutrons.</li>
                <li>Tritium breeding. A fusion power plant will need to breed its own tritium due to the scarce stores we have here on Earth (Annual production is 20kg. A 500 MW fusion power plant will require ~ 50kg <sup><a href="Citations.html">1</a></sup>). Such a process could potentially take place in the blanket, with ITER set to trial this in the later years of its operation. </li>
                <li>Recover energy from the emitted radiation and fusion products to eventually be converted to electrical energy. This will be achieved via the conventional methods of a thermal power plant.</li>
                <li>Maintain an impurity-free plasma domain. The first wall of the reactor blanket (as well as the divertor) are the structures that face direct contact with the plasma, and so must be engineered to minimise high Z-number atoms entering the plasma domain, whilst being fashioned from a material that can withstand an extremely high heat flux. </li>
                </ol>
                
                ITER will line the inside of their vessel with 1 x 1.5 metre blanket modules that aim to accomplish all four tasks. Following the order of the list above, we'll begin with how the blanket serves as a shield to other components of the tokamak. <br><br>
                
                <h2 id="titles" text-align="left" color="white" >Shielding</h2>
                Let's first delve further into the question of what we are shielding <i>from</i>. You may recall from previous pages that a fusion reaction involves two 
                isotopes of hydrogen as reactants (deuterium and tritium), which fuse and form two 
                products, an alpha (&#593;)  particle and a neutron. The reactants in this process 
                have a higher rest mass than the products, and so conservation of energy dictates that 
                the neutron and &#593; particle carry 17.6 MeV more kinetic energy than the products, of which 
                14.1 MeV is held by the neutron, and 3.5 MeV by the &#593;. 
                <figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" width=100% height=300px alt="A placeholder" src="placeholder.png"><figcaption>Figure 2: The hell you looking at</figcaption></figure>
                <br>The presence of the 14.1 MeV neutron is quite a pressing matter, as its interactions with surrounding structures are problematic to say the least.
                On collision with the reactor walls, the neutron can displace the wall's constituent molecules (a process known as sputtering) which often find a way 
                back into the plasma (backscattering). The effects of this are discussed in greater detail on the  
             <a href="Divertors.html">Divertor</a> page, but know that the presence of such impurities is only detrimental to achieving 
                net power output. The neutron also attacks the strutural integrity of surfaces it is incident upon, with the microscopic 
                voids left by the sputtered atoms becoming larger over time, leading to cracks and changes in the macroscopic behaviour of 
                the material. Diffusion of helium and tritium into the material structure further contribute to the degradation of the first wall. Mitigating this effect could save a good deal of money on the operational costs of a fusion power plant, by 
                reducing the need for replacement parts every few years. Further issues stemming from the 14.1 MeV neutron include the unwanted heating
                of the superconducting magnets confining the plasma (), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation" target="blank">neutron activation</a> and exposure of nearby organisms to ionising radiation, amplified by outgoing brehmsstralung and line emission radiation.<br>
                <br>To combat these problems, a tremendous amount of work has gone into developing effective shielding systems.  
                With regards to the structure and location of such systems, in practically all machines there exists some shielding 
                directly behind the first wall (the structure in direct contact with the plasma domain) with auxiliary shielding 
                modules embedded deeper in the blanket to provide additional protection to the magnets from high energy neutrons and 
                electromagnetic radiation, depicted in figure 2. Shields have thicknesses in the order of 10<sup>1</sup>cm, but due 
                to the stringent conditions on dimensions  (imposed with the goal of creating a compact reactor in mind), the real 
                beauty in these modules is the materials science that has been employed to make them as effective as possible. 
                <br>
                Unsurprisingly, Tungsten is a frontrunner in the list of potential shield materials. Its high melting point, low 
                coefficient of thermal expansion and low chance of neutrons activation make it well suited to the inside of a fusion 
                reactor, with its resistance to erosion also proving highly desirable. This can be seen if we define the sputtering 
                ratio, S, as the number of wall atoms back sputtered into the plasma per plasma ion incident on the wall;  from experiment we 
                find that Tungsten has the lowest sputtering ratio of the compounds found in a fusion reactor across practically all incident energies.
                <br> There are, of course, shortcomings. A limited temperature range, bounded by what are known as the brittle to 
                ductile transition temperature (BDTT) and the recrystallization temperature, constrict the range in which a metal can 
                be used as an effective structural material. In short, the BDTT is the temperature range below which a metal will lose its malleable properties, and in the process will become unsuitable to bear large stresses. The recrystallization temperature (range) can be summarised as follows: when large stresses are applied to a metal, its component crystallites (the microscopic crystals that make up the metal, also known as grains), are deformed, which endow the metal with suitable properties to be used in extreme conditions, such as increased tensile strength and hardness. At and above the recrystallization temperature range, these deformed grains are replaced by a new set of (undistorted) crystallites, making the metal lose such properties and not appropriate to use in say a tokamak. 
                Unfortunately, the BDTT and the recrystallization temperature for tungsten are relatively close<sup>1, reference</sup>, posing
                a restriction on its effectiveness as a shielding material. Other factors, involving the extremely high tendency for tungsten 
                to oxidize at high temperatures as well as the difficulty in manipulating the shape of forged tungsten provide incentives to 
                look for more suitable materials to be used to line the inside of a tokamak. 
                <br>A prime contender for the shielding material to be used inside a tokamak is 
                a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_matrix_composite" target="blank_">metal matrix composite </a> containing tungsten carbide/boride 
                (WC/WB). By embedding WC/WB (the aggregate) in a metal binder, which is likely to be an alloy of iron and chromium, the resultant material is endowed with desirable qualities from both components; we see that the brittle nature of the aggregate is overcome by the ductility of the binder, and the WC particles harden the material further. One may ask why a tungsten <i>carbide/boride</i>  ceramic is used as supposed to a tungsten, iron and chromium-based alloy, but upon learning that carbon is an effective neutron moderator, and boron-10 can absorb neutrons without becoming radioactive, the reason should be clear. To do justice to the breadth of literature that exists covering the topics above, as well as the underlying physics and chemistry, multiple webpages would have to be created; to keep things fairly concise I'll end this section by mentioning that the proposed ceramic metal composites also have lower sputtering ratios than pure tungsten (on average by a factor 4) and a lower coefficient of thermal expansion.
