                The arrangement of the magnets inside a tokamak are its defining feature; in fact, the name 'tokamak' is an acronym of four Russian words that roughly translate to 'toroidal chamber with magnetic coils'. 
                In practically all cases, a tokamak requires 3 magnetic fields, each with their own function. These are the toroidal field, the poloidal field and multiple 'correction' fields which we'll denote as B<sub>&phi;</sub>, B<sub>&theta;</sub> and B<sub>cor</sub> respectively. 
                It is most convenient to describe the geometry of a tokamak with regards to radial, poloidal and toroidal coordinates as I have above, so for those unfamiliar with the system, Figure 1 provides a simple visualisation.
                The blue arrow denotes the toroidal direction and the red is the poloidal direction.
                With that being said, in a tokamak the magnitude of the fields is such that B<sub>&phi;</sub> > B<sub>&theta;</sub> > B<sub>cor</sub> , so for this reason we'll begin the discussion with the toroidal field.

            There perhaps may never exist a material that can confine plasmas at the temperatures required for nuclear fusion, 
            so it was decided very early on in fusion efforts that the most effective method of 'bottling up' the particles in a plasma would be 
            through the use of magnetic fields. The toroidal field does this job in the tokamak; the particles gyrate around the field lines 
            which themselves have a circular path around the circumference of the machine, and with the assistance of the other fields the plasma 
            does not expand towards the reactor walls (most of the time!). As indicated by Figure 2 on the right, the toroidal field is induced by magnets parallel to 
            planes of constant toroidal angle. Note that the shape of a toroidal field inducing coil is not a perfect circle as one might expect, but instead a 'D' shape. Due to the 
            curved shape of the tokamak, the sides of the magnets facing the plasma are more densely packed together. If we were to consider just one toroidal field coil, we'd see that this leads
            to higher internal magnetic pressure on this inward facing side. This 'D' coil ensures a similar magnetic tension force on both inward and outward facing sides of 
            a coil, reducing the effects of damaging strains on the magnets. <br>
            Brilliant, so now we've confined our plasma in a torus with a  'D' shaped cross section. Or have we? As you may have guessed, it is not quite this simple to hold a plasma
            in the equiibrium that is required for sustained power production. Let's delve into the reason why. <br>
            <div><figure id="bigfig"><img id="bigimg" src="tokamakmagnets.jpg" alt="The magnets in a tokamak" id="right" ><figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption></figure></div>

            It is quite evident as to why a circular arrangement of magnets was chosen to confine a plasma over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_mirror#:~:text=A%20magnetic%20mirror%2C%20known%20as,temperature%20plasma%20using%20magnetic%20fields.">Magnetic Mirrors</a>; particle leakages in the latter were too numerous to obtain
            scientific breakeven (where the power released by the fusion reactions is equal to the heating power). Unfortunately, the circular configuration of toroidal field magnets comes with its own problems that require the use of other magnetic fields to correct.<br>
            Let's start by considering how a particle moves when subject to various fields. The field configurations of interest are:
            <ul>
                <li>Homogenous <b>B</b> field</li>
                <li>Combined homogenous <b>B</b> and <b>E</b> field</li>
                <li>Spatially varying <b>B</b> field</li>
                <li>Curved <b>B</b> field</li>
            </ul>
            A particle in all four fields exhibits some type of gyration about the field lines, but the final three each cause a unique drift on the guiding centre of the gyration. To best see this, I have plotted the motion below using MATLAB.
            <br><br>IMAGES IMAGES IMAGES IMAGES<br><br>
            Why is this a problem? As depicted above, a spatially varying and/or curved <b>B</b> field induce a drift on the particle guiding centre. Now consider the toroidal field we discussed; clearly the field lines are curved and as the magnets are more tightly packed on the inner side of the tokamak, the magnitude of the <b>B</b> field is proportional 
            to the inverse of the radial distance from the tokamak centre. When combining the particle drifts that the toroidal field causes, we see that
            electrons drift vertically downwards and ions are forced upwards. This separation of charged particles (polarization) then induces an <b>E</b> field, leading to an <b>ExB</b> drift that is directed radially outwards, irrespective of the type of charge (Please refer to the figure 3 to see a diagrammatic depiction.). Such
            an event cannot be allowed to happen. For the continuous operation of a tokamak, we need the plasma in equilibrium, i.e the average force on the plasma over some time period is zero. Minimising the number
            of particles hitting the reactor wall is also desirable, as it leads to less impurities entering the plasma (impurities cause rapid cooling hence insufficient temperatures for fusion reactions, please see the <a href="Divertor.html">Divertor</a> page for a more in-depth discussion.) Now we can finally introduce the 
            poloidal magnetic field, which serves as a solution to this problem.

            <h2 id="titles" text-align="left" color="white" >Poloidal field</h2>
            The aim of the poloidal field is to prevent the radial <b>ExB</b> drift, and this is achieved by preventing the charge polarization.
            To think about this, let's place a tokamak on a Cartesian coordinate grid, and consider a surface bounded by a circular field line of the toroidal field that lies parallel to the x-y plane. The z axis passes through
            the centre of the torus. Now, let's run a current through the plasma in a toroidal direction, the effect of this is the generation of a poloidal field around the whole of the tokamak (green lines in figure 2). If we were now to consider
            a particle in motion, we can see that if it has some non-zero velocity in the z direction pushing it to the top or bottom of the machine, the poloidal field induce a restoring radial force
