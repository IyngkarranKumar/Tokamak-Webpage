                The arrangement of the magnets inside a tokamak are its defining feature; in fact, the name 'tokamak' itself is an acronym of four Russian words that roughly translate to 'toroidal chamber with magnetic coils'. 
                In practically all cases, a tokamak requires 3 magnetic fields, each with their own function. These are the toroidal field, the poloidal field and multiple 'correction' fields  which we'll denote as B<sub>&phi;</sub>, B<sub>&theta;</sub> and B<sub>cor</sub> respectively. 
                It is convenient to describe the geometry of a tokamak with regards to radial, poloidal and toroidal coordinates as I have above, so for those unfamiliar with the system, Figure 1 provides a simple visualisation.
                The blue arrow denotes the toroidal direction and the red is the poloidal direction.
                With that being said, in a tokamak the magnitude of the fields is such that B<sub>&phi;</sub> > B<sub>&theta;</sub> > B<sub>cor</sub> , so for this reason we'll begin the discussion with the toroidal field.

            It was realised very early on in fusion efforts that the only viable way of confining a  100 million-degree plasma for a 
            sustained period of time would be through the use of magnetic fields, and it is the toroidal field that is mainly 
            responsible for this. Figure 2 depicts a toroidal field line in blue that circles around the circumference of the tokamak 
            and is produced by passing a current through large superconducting D-shaped coils  (20 metres in diameter in ITERs case!) 
            which are situated parallel to planes of constant toroidal angle. Particles of the plasma gyrate around these field lines 
            (this motion is shown in Figures 3-6) and in an ideal world would maintain this motion for a sufficiently long
            time such that enough fusion reactions can occur to produce a net energy gain. <br>
            One may also ask why toroidal field 
            coils must be D-shaped, as after all a similar configuration of circular coils should produce the same field. The reason 
            for this is due to the curvature of the tokamak, which means coils become more tightly packed together on the side facing 
            the plasma leading to a higher magnetic field energy density (magnetic pressure) in this region; the D-shape allows for 
            the parts of the magnet in this higher field area to bear the additional stresses that come from being in such a position.<br>

            However we find that the toroidal field itself is not able to confine the plasma by itself, and the reasons for this once 
            again come down to the curved nature of the magnet configuration. Firstly, it is important to note that a linear 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_mirror#:~:text=A%20magnetic%20mirror%2C%20known%20as,temperature%20plasma%20using%20magnetic%20fields.">'Magnetic Mirror'</a> method of confining a plasma is simply unable to accomplish such a thing, due to the high particle leakage 
            out of both ends. The circular set up solves this (the particles cannot leak out anywhere), but in doing so leads to 
            unfavourable particle motion that requires additional magnetic fields to negate, as discussed now. We begin by considering the motion
            of a single charged particle subjected to the following fields:<br>
            <br><ul>
                <li>Homogenous <b>B</b> field</li>
                <li>Combined homogenous <b>B</b> and <b>E</b> field</li>
                <li>Spatially varying <b>B</b> field</li>
                <li>Curved <b>B</b> field</li>
            </ul>
            A particle in all four fields exhibits some type of gyration about the field lines, but the final three each cause a unique drift on the guiding centre of the gyration. To best see this, I have plotted the motion below using MATLAB.

            Why is this a problem? As depicted above, a spatially varying and/or curved <b>B</b> field induce a drift on the particle guiding centre (this guiding centre is the point about which the particle gyrates, shown approximately by the green line). Now consider the toroidal field we discussed; clearly the field lines are curved and as the magnets are more tightly packed on the inner side of the tokamak, the magnitude of the <b>B</b> field is proportional 
            to the inverse of the radial distance from the tokamak centre (thereby introducing the 'grad B' drift'). When combining the particle drifts that the toroidal field causes, we see that
            electrons drift vertically downwards and ions are forced upwards. This separation of charged particles (polarization) then induces an <b>E</b> field, leading to an <b>ExB</b> drift that is directed radially outwards, irrespective of the type of charge (Please refer to the figure 3 to see a diagrammatic depiction.). Such
            an event cannot be allowed to happen. For the continuous operation of a tokamak, we need the plasma in equilibrium, i.e the average force on the plasma over some time period is zero. Minimising the number
            of particles hitting the reactor wall is also desirable, as it leads to less impurities entering the plasma (impurities cause rapid cooling hence insufficient temperatures for fusion reactions, please see the <a href="Divertor.html">Divertor</a> page for a more in-depth discussion.) Now we can finally introduce the 
            poloidal magnetic field, which serves as a solution to this problem.

            <h2 id="titles" text-align="left" color="white" >Poloidal field</h2>
            The aim of the poloidal field is to prevent the radial <b>ExB</b> drift, and this is achieved by preventing the charge polarization.
            To think about this, let's place a tokamak on a Cartesian coordinate grid, and consider a surface bounded by a circular field line of the toroidal field that lies parallel to the x-y plane. The z axis passes through
            the centre of the torus. Now, let's run a current through the plasma in a toroidal direction, the effect of this is the generation of a poloidal field around the whole of the tokamak (green lines in figure 2). If we were now to consider
            a particle in motion, we can see that if it has some non-zero velocity in the z direction pushing it to the top or bottom of the machine, the poloidal field induce a restoring radial force
